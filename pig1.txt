[training@localhost ~]$ cat > comment
hadoop is great 
spark is great
you are also great
hadoop and spark combination is great 
[training@localhost ~]$ hadoop fs -mkdir pdemo
[training@localhost ~]$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal comment  pdemo
[training@localhost ~]$ 


grunt> lines = load 'pdemo/comment'  
>>          as (line:chararray);
grunt> words = foreach lines generate 
>>     FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(line)) as word;
grunt> grp = group words by word;
grunt> res = foreach grp generate
>>        group as word, COUNT(words) as cnt;
grunt> store res into 'pigRes1';

grunt> ls pigRes1         
hdfs://localhost/user/training/pigRes1/_logs    <dir>
hdfs://localhost/user/training/pigRes1/part-r-00000<r 1>  69
grunt> cat pigRes1/part-r-00000
is      3
and     1
are     1
you     1
also    1
great   4
spark   2
hadoop  2
combination     1
grunt> 

to change delimiter:

 grunt> store res into 'pigRes2' using PigStorage(',');

grunt> ls pigRes2
hdfs://localhost/user/training/pigRes2/_logs    <dir>
hdfs://localhost/user/training/pigRes2/part-r-00000<r 1>  
grunt> cat pigRes2/part-r-00000
is,3
and,1
are,1
you,1
also,1
great,4
